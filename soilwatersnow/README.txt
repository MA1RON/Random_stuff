This model simulates a transient in which there are three elements: soil, 
water and snow. Soil grows by itself for sismic reasons, and it's eroded 
by water. Water falls where at the bottom of the soil, and if it's higher
than a certain point it freezes and becomes snow. Water also evaporates 
by itself with time. Snow condenses into water under the freezing treshold.
Have fun!
